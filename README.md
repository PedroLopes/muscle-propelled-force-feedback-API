muscle-propelled-force-feedback-API
===================================

API for interfacing with the muscle propelled force feedback project (video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swmGaGT8lvs) 

There are to different versions of the hardware:
1. (simple) relay version, you can manually calibrate how much power the EMS drives, but digital control only allows you to open/close a relay, thus open/close the EMS signal. 
2. (complex) voltage control version, you can digitally control the intensity of the EMS amplifiers. 

This GIT supports only the 1st version. Please email me if you are interested in the second, more ellaborate, construct.
